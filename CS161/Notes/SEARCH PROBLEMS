SEARCH PROBLEMS

	- Initial state
	- Final state
	- Successor fn
		- Transitions
	- Cost function
	- Goal test

	- Optimal solution reaches the goal at the lowest possible cost (complexity).

	example: "Three color problem"
	3 colors, n-by-n grid, no two adj cells have the same color. 4^(n^2) possible colorings,
	but not all of them are acceptable/legal.
	IS: No cells are colored.
	FS: All cells are colored.
	Actions: Coloring cells, e.g., color(i, j, c) where (i, j) are the coordinates
			 of a cell and c is one of three colors.

SEARCH STRATEGIES

	Differ wrt expansion of nodes from the fringe.
	Judged based on four characteristics:
		Time-complexity: # of steps necessary before goal is reached. 
						 # of nodes expanded before goal is reached.
		Search-complexity
		Optimality
		Completeness
