Changelog - 01/26/2013
Author: Prianna Ahsan

==================================================================
query.php: line 65, changed if-else statement to ternary operator
to clean up the script. 

if ($attr[$attrCount] != NULL)
	echo "$attr[$attrCount]";
else
	echo 'N/A';
echo '</td>';

WAS CHANGED TO:

$attribute = $attr[$attrCount] ? $attr[$attrCount] : 'N/A';
echo "$attribute";
echo '</td>';

==================================================================
query.sql: Changed name to queries.sql to match spec. Adding test
queries to the bottom as they come.
==================================================================

Iâ€™ve only made (or had to make) minor changes thus far. What did
you mean by practically no error-checking?

Hey P, 
Still working on the last part. I've implemented some constraints that I thought were obvious
but, of course, if you can think of anything I missed - go at it.

I think the query.php is working fine now, had some interesting times with making it display in
a table and center the font. Turns out that was easy but it was driving me crazy because of
silly little mistakes.

I'll keep ya posted on progress.

P.S. I'm doing practically no error checking in create.sql, so remind me to look into it!

====================================================
Update 1/26/14 1:30PM

I think I finished the thing, it's probably not optimal or sexy but we can always clean it up later. 
I couldn't really think of any original ways to show why shit fails in violate.sql, aside from directly
adding/removing incorrect things.

Still have to do some error checking, even though I just saw in the project description we can assume, for
this project only, that user input is not bollocks.

Ya, that's it, methinks. Gonna start working on 151B and Astro, got midterms on Wednesday and Thursday.
Hope you're feeling better today! Load up on more tea. NOW, I say!
