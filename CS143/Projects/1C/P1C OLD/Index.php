<h1>This is the main hangout area.</h1>
<p>Let's hangout, yay! <br>
Maybe a picture or welcome message of some sort would go here? <br><br>

By the way, feel free to change the color scheme and layout, for some reason the .css file<br>
isn't working correctly on my end, otherwise the colors would be different.<br>
White blue and gold are very Bruin but not sexy.<br>

<br>
<b>What appears to be working alright, at least to some extent:</b><br>
-browse actors/directors<br>
-browse movies<br>
-search<br>

<br>
<b>I still need to implement (need to pick up Max ID from 1-B to add new records but I don't remember if I implemented it before):</b><br>
-add actor/director<br>
-add movie are not implemented yet<br>
-add relation<br>
-adding reviews<br>
