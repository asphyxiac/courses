Implemented all functionality for BTreeIndex class and checked logic like a billion times. Fixed error codes and error reporting in BTLeafNode class. Need to fix a bunch of shit in BTNonLeafNode class, including logical errors, memory/pointer arithmetic errors, and error reporting (e.g. returned RC values). Need to test BTreeIndex and BTreeNode classes in concert to ensure that everything is working. 

Will probably have to write some test functions that a. fill the tree with junk, b. assert that junk is where it should be and c. print out the tree.
Argh. Testing this is going to suck.

As the title says, check 2B/Prianna_In_Progress/Bruinbase for most recent source.
